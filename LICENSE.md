# HUMORIST LICENSE (HL)

Oh, you found my LICENSE file! You must be one of those diligent folks who always looks for a LICENSE file in every project. Well, you've come to the right place! But let's get one thing straight: this project is as private as my Netflix password, so this license is more of a comedy act than a legal document.

## Terms and Conditions
1. Use at Your Own Risk
    - If you can even access this project, you've probably hacked into my private repository. In that case, bravo! But remember, with great power comes great responsibility. Or not. I’m not your mom.

2. Copying and Redistribution
    - Sure, go ahead and copy this code. Spread it far and wide. Show it to your friends, your cat, your goldfish. Just don’t expect it to work or be useful in any way. This is my private playground, after all.

3. Modification
    - Feel free to modify the code. Paint it purple, add a dancing unicorn, make it do your laundry. Whatever floats your boat. But don't blame me if your modifications make your computer catch fire.

4. Private Use Only
    - This project is meant for private use only. So private, in fact, that even I’m not sure why I wrote a LICENSE file. If you’re reading this, you’re either incredibly curious or incredibly bored. Either way, welcome!

5. No Warranty
    - This project comes with absolutely no warranty. None. Zilch. Nada. If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces.

6. No Liability
    - If you somehow manage to cause a global meltdown, a zombie apocalypse, or just make your computer really sad by using this code, that's on you. I take no responsibility. Not now, not ever.

7. Support
    - Looking for support? You've come to the wrong place, my friend. There's no helpdesk, no FAQ, no “contact us” page. 
You're on your own in this wild adventure.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this LICENSE file is as useful as a chocolate teapot. But hey, you’ve got to have a bit of humor in life, right? So go forth, brave explorer of private projects, and may your code never break in ways you can’t fix.

P.S. If you’re still reading this, you either have a great sense of humor or way too much time on your hands. Either way, thanks for the laugh!
